NAME

    DBIx::XML::DataLoader

VERSION 

    1.0b

DESCRIPTION

    DBIx::XML::DataLoader is a tool for loading data from a xml
    document into any DB datasource. It will also load data into a xml
    document from a DB datasource. 

    The module uses a custom map file written in xml to holding the information
     needed to traverse the xml data source and load the data into the 
    appropriate DB datasource. 

    With this system there is no real limitation to the type of xml document holding 
    your data. There is also no limitation to the number of DB datasources that can be 
    loaded from one xml document.


WARNING 

    This is beta software and should be used with caution.

STATUS AND SUPPORT

     This is a beta version of DBIx::XML::DataLoader .
     Development has been mostly done with a Oracle database.
     I have also tested this code using mysql. I have done no
     testing with other DB drivers although I assume things should
     work fine using other drivers.
